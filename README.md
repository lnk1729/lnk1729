## Hey there 👋, Prathiksh here
I'm a seasoned software developer with over 6.5 years of experience. 
My journey has taken me through some incredible companies like Treebo Hotels and Siemens, I've also ventured into the dynamic world of early-stage startups.

### 🚀 Professional Journey

**R&D:** <br/>I focused on R&D, particularly on minimizing installation sizes of native desktop apps. My work also involved developing proprietary compilers and interpreters.<br/>
**Mobile Apps:** <br/>Transitioning into mobile app development, React Native became my forte. My experience also includes managing large-scale applications with 10-15k daily active users, ensuring they run smoothly and efficiently.I've also built a couple of apps from scratch.<br/>
**Backend:** <br/>I've delved into backend tech as well. Wouldn't call myself an expert, but I've got good working understanding of Django, GraphQL and MySQL.

Currently, I'm expanding my horizons by exploring Flutter. Somebody's gotta end that RN vs Flutter debate right? 🤷🏻‍♂️

### 🛠️ Skills
**Languages**: JavaScript, Typescript, Python, C#, C++<br/>
**Frameworks**: React, React Native, Django, Flutter, DotNET Core, Apollo<br/>

### 🏃‍♂️ Personal Interests
When I'm not coding, you can find me on the badminton court or playing football (The British one).
